# Sample RESTful API w/ Loopback

## Overview

## Guide to create your own
1. Install Loopback CLI `npm install -g loopback-cli`

3. Run the application using `node .`
4. Visit `localhost:3000/explorer` and you'll see the SwaggerAPI with your routes setup
5. Connect MongoDB `npm install --save loopback-connector-mongodb`. Make sure you have MongoDB running!
6. Connect the connector `lb datasource mongoDS --connector mongoDB`
7. Run `lb model` to create data models. You'll again be prompted with questions, answer according to the type of model you wish to create
8. After adding a model, visit `localhost:3000/explorer` to see your new routes
9. To set up authentication, run `lb acl` and answer the questions accordingly
